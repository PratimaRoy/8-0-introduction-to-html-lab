    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A BLT is a type of sandwich, named for the initials of its primary ingredients, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. It can be made with varying recipes according to personal preference. Simple variants include using different types of lettuce, toasting or not, or adding mayonnaise.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices bacon (regular, not thick cut)</li> 
            <li> 1 small tomato</li> 
            <li>Kosher salt</li> 
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li> 
            <li>2 slices hearty white sandwich bread</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li> 
            <li>1 romaine lettuce leaf</li>
    </ul> <hr>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook 3 slices bacon, using one of these methods: stove, oven, or microwave. (If you're making several BLTs, use the oven to cook the bacon, as it's the easiest way to cook a lot of bacon). Make sure every slice is evenly crispy with no areas of unrendered fat. No flabbiness allowed! Transfer to a paper towel to drain.</li>
        <li>Slice 1 small tomato crosswise with a serrated knife into 1/3-inch thick slices. Place the slices in a single layer on a double layer of paper towels (the towels will absorb some of the moisture, preventing a soggy sandwich). Season lightly with kosher salt and some black pepper. Let sit while you toast the bread.
        </li>
        <li>Toast 2 slices white sandwich bread until light golden brown.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 tablespoon mayonnaise on each slice of bread. Place 1 romaine lettuce leaf on one slice of bread, folding it as needed to fit neatly on the bread. Top with the seasoned tomato slices in a single layer (no need to pat the top dry), cutting them in half as needed to fit in a single layer. Tear the 3 bacon slices in half and place on top of the tomatoes in 2 layers. Close the sandwich with the second slice of bread mayonnaise-side down.</li>
        <li>Cut the BLT in half. Gently press down on the top of the sandwich to compact slightly. Cut in half with the serrated knife and serve immediately.</li>
